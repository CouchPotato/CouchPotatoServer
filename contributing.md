## Got a issue/feature request or submitting a pull request?

Make sure you think of the following things:

## Issue
 * Search through the existing (and closed) issues first, see if you can get your answer there.
 * Double check the result manually, because it could be an external issue. 
 * Post logs! Without seeing what is going on, I can't reproduce the error.
 * Also check the logs before submitting, obvious errors like permission or http errors are often not related to CP.
 * What is the movie + quality you are searching for?
 * What are you're settings for the specific problem?
 * What providers are you using? (While you're logs include these, scanning through hundred of lines of log isn't our hobby)
 * Post the logs from config directory, please do not copy paste the UI. Use pastebin to store these logs!
 * Give a short step by step of how to reproduce the error.
 * What hardware / OS are you using and what are the limits? NAS can be slow and maybe have a different python installed then when you use CP on OSX or Windows for example.
 * I will mark issues with the "can't reproduce" tag. Don't go asking "why closed" if it clearly says the issue in the tag ;)
 * If you're running on a NAS (QNAP, Austor etc..) with pre-made packages, make sure these are setup to use our source repo (RuudBurger/CouchPotatoServer) and nothing else!!

## Pull Request
 * Make sure you're pull request is made for develop branch (or relevant feature branch)
 * Have you tested your PR? If not, why?
 * Are there any limitations of your PR we should know of?
 * Make sure to keep you're PR up-to-date with the branch you're trying to push into.

**If we don't get enough info, the chance of the issue getting closed is a lot bigger ;)**
