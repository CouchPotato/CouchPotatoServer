#So you feel like posting a bug, sending me a pull request or just telling me how awesome I am. No problem! 

##Just make sure you think of the following things:

 * Search through the existing (and closed) issues first. See if you can get your answer there.
 * Double check the result manually, because it could be an external issue. 
 * Post logs! Without seeing what is going on, I can't reproduce the error.
 * What are you settings for the specific problem
 * What providers are you using. (While your logs include these, scanning through hundred of lines of log isn't my hobby)
 * Give me a short step by step of how to reproduce
 * What hardware / OS are you using and what are the limits? NAS can be slow and maybe have a different python installed then when you use CP on OSX or Windows for example.
 * I will mark issues with the "can't reproduce" tag. Don't go asking me "why closed" if it clearly says the issue in the tag ;)

**If I don't get enough info, the change of the issue getting closed is a lot bigger ;)**
