"""HTTP cookie handling for web clients.

This module originally developed from my port of Gisle Aas' Perl module
HTTP::Cookies, from the libwww-perl library.

Docstrings, comments and debug strings in this code refer to the
attributes of the HTTP cookie system as cookie-attributes, to distinguish
them clearly from Python attributes.

    In addition to the features required to implement the CookiePolicy
    interface, this class allows you to block and allow domains from setting
    and receiving cookies.  There are also some strictness switches that allow
    you to tighten up the rather loose Netscape protocol rules a little bit (at
    the cost of blocking some benign cookies).

    A domain blacklist and whitelist is provided (both off by default).  Only
    domains not in the blacklist and present in the whitelist (if the whitelist
    is active) participate in cookie setting and returning.  Use the
    blocked_domains constructor argument, and blocked_domains and
    set_blocked_domains methods (and the corresponding argument and methods for
    allowed_domains).  If you set a whitelist, you can turn it off again by
    setting it to None.

    Domains in block or allow lists that do not start with a dot must
    string-compare equal.  For example, "acme.com" matches a blacklist entry of
    "acme.com", but "www.acme.com" does not.  Domains that do start with a dot
    are matched by more specific domains too.  For example, both "www.acme.com"
    and "www.munitions.acme.com" match ".acme.com" (but "acme.com" itself does
    not).  IP addresses are an exception, and must match exactly.  For example,
    if blocked_domains contains "192.168.1.2" and ".168.1.2" 192.168.1.2 is
    blocked, but 193.168.1.2 is not.

    General strictness switches

    strict_domain: don't allow sites to set two-component domains with
     country-code top-level domains like .co.uk, .gov.uk, .co.nz. etc.
     This is far from perfect and isn't guaranteed to work!

    RFC 2965 protocol strictness switches

    strict_rfc2965_unverifiable: follow RFC 2965 rules on unverifiable
     transactions (usually, an unverifiable transaction is one resulting from
     a redirect or an image hosted on another site); if this is false, cookies
     are NEVER blocked on the basis of verifiability

    Netscape protocol strictness switches

    strict_ns_unverifiable: apply RFC 2965 rules on unverifiable transactions
     even to Netscape cookies
    strict_ns_domain: flags indicating how strict to be with domain-matching
     rules for Netscape cookies:
      DomainStrictNoDots: when setting cookies, host prefix must not contain a
       dot (e.g. www.foo.bar.com can't set a cookie for .bar.com, because
       www.foo contains a dot)
      DomainStrictNonDomain: cookies that did not explicitly specify a Domain
       cookie-attribute can only be returned to a domain that string-compares
       equal to the domain that set the cookie (e.g. rockets.acme.com won't
       be returned cookies from acme.com that had no Domain cookie-attribute)
      DomainRFC2965Match: when setting cookies, require a full RFC 2965
       domain-match
      DomainLiberal and DomainStrict are the most useful combinations of the
       above flags, for convenience
    strict_ns_set_initial_dollar: ignore cookies in Set-Cookie: headers that
     have names starting with '$'
    strict_ns_set_path: don't allow setting cookies whose path doesn't
     path-match request URI
