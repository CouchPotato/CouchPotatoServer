""" This module allows you to translate and execute Javascript in pure python.
    Basically its implementation of ECMAScript 5.1 in pure python.

    Use eval_js method to execute javascript code and get resulting python object (builtin if possible).

    EXAMPLE:
    >>> import js2py
    >>> add = js2py.eval_js('function add(a, b) {return a + b}')
    >>> add(1, 2) + 3
    6
    >>> add('1', 2, 3)
    u'12'
    >>> add.constructor
    function Function() { [python code] }


    Or use EvalJs to execute many javascript code fragments under same context - you would be able to get any
    variable from the context!

    >>> js = js2py.EvalJs()
    >>> js.execute('var a = 10; function f(x) {return x*x};')
    >>> js.f(9)
    81
    >>> js.a
    10

    Also you can use its console method to play with interactive javascript console.


    Use parse_js to parse (syntax tree is just like in esprima.js) and translate_js to trasnlate JavaScript.

    Finally, you can use pyimport statement from inside JS code to import and use python libraries.

    >>> js2py.eval_js('pyimport urllib; urllib.urlopen("https://www.google.com")')

    NOTE: This module is still not fully finished:

          Date and JSON builtin objects are not implemented
          Array prototype is not fully finished (will be soon)

    Other than that everything should work fine.
