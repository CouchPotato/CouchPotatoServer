Benchmark a function for its behavior with respect to N.

How to use this module:

1. Define a function which runs the code that you want to benchmark. The
function takes a single argument which is the size of the task (i.e. the "N"
parameter). Pass this function as the first argument to rep_bench(), and N as
the second, e.g.:

>>> from pyutil.benchutil import rep_bench
>>> def fib(N):
...  if N <= 1:
...   return 1
...  else:
...   return fib(N-1) + fib(N-2)
...
>>> rep_bench(fib, 25, UNITS_PER_SECOND=1000)
best: 1.968e+00,   3th-best: 1.987e+00, mean: 2.118e+00,   3th-worst: 2.175e+00, worst: 2.503e+00 (of     10)

The output is reporting the number of milliseconds that executing the function
took, divided by N, from ten different invocations of fib(). It reports the
best, worst, M-th best, M-th worst, and mean, where "M" is the natural log of
the number of invocations (in this case 10).

2. Now run it with different values of N and look for patterns:

>>> for N in 1, 5, 9, 13, 17, 21:
...  print "%2d" % N,
...  rep_bench(fib, N, UNITS_PER_SECOND=1000000)
... 
 1 best: 9.537e-01,   3th-best: 9.537e-01, mean: 1.121e+00,   3th-worst: 1.192e+00, worst: 2.146e+00 (of     10)
 5 best: 5.722e-01,   3th-best: 6.199e-01, mean: 7.200e-01,   3th-worst: 8.106e-01, worst: 8.106e-01 (of     10)
 9 best: 2.437e+00,   3th-best: 2.464e+00, mean: 2.530e+00,   3th-worst: 2.570e+00, worst: 2.676e+00 (of     10)
13 best: 1.154e+01,   3th-best: 1.168e+01, mean: 5.638e+01,   3th-worst: 1.346e+01, worst: 4.478e+02 (of     10)
17 best: 6.230e+01,   3th-best: 6.247e+01, mean: 6.424e+01,   3th-worst: 6.460e+01, worst: 7.294e+01 (of     10)
21 best: 3.376e+02,   3th-best: 3.391e+02, mean: 3.521e+02,   3th-worst: 3.540e+02, worst: 3.963e+02 (of     10)
>>> print_bench_footer(UNITS_PER_SECOND=1000000)
all results are in time units per N
time units per second: 1000000; seconds per time unit: 0.000001

(The pattern here is that as N grows, the time per N grows.)

2. If you need to do some setting up before the code can run, then put the
setting-up code into a separate function so that it won't be included in the
timing measurements. A good way to share state between the setting-up function
and the main function is to make them be methods of the same object, e.g.:

>>> import random
>>> class O:
...  def __init__(self):
...   self.l = []
...  def setup(self, N):
...   del self.l[:]
...   self.l.extend(range(N))
...   random.shuffle(self.l)
...  def sort(self, N):
...   self.l.sort()
...
>>> o = O()
>>> for N in 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000:
...  print "%7d" % N,
...  rep_bench(o.sort, N, o.setup)
...
   1000 best: 4.830e+02,   3th-best: 4.950e+02, mean: 5.730e+02,   3th-worst: 5.858e+02, worst: 7.451e+02 (of     10)
  10000 best: 6.342e+02,   3th-best: 6.367e+02, mean: 6.678e+02,   3th-worst: 6.851e+02, worst: 7.848e+02 (of     10)
 100000 best: 8.309e+02,   3th-best: 8.338e+02, mean: 8.435e+02,   3th-worst: 8.540e+02, worst: 8.559e+02 (of     10)
1000000 best: 1.327e+03,   3th-best: 1.339e+03, mean: 1.349e+03,   3th-worst: 1.357e+03, worst: 1.374e+03 (of     10)

3. Useful fact! rep_bench() returns a dict containing the numbers.

4. Things to fix:

 a. I used to have it hooked up to use the "hotshot" profiler on the code being
 measured. I recently tried to change it to use the newer cProfile profiler
 instead, but I don't understand the interface to cProfiler so it just gives an
 exception if you pass profile=True. Please fix this and send me a patch.

 b. Wouldn't it be great if this script emitted results in a json format that
 was understood by a tool to make pretty interactive explorable graphs? The
 pretty graphs could look like those on http://speed.pypy.org/ . Please make
 this work and send me a patch!
