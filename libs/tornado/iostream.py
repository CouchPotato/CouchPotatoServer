    This class supports the read and write methods from `BaseIOStream`
    plus a `connect` method.

    The ``socket`` parameter may either be connected or unconnected.

    `socket.accept <socket.socket.accept>`.  For client operations the
    socket is created with `socket.socket`, and may either be
    connected before passing it to the `IOStream` or connected with
