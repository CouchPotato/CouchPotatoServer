class TCPServer(object):
    r"""A non-blocking, single-threaded TCP server.

    To use `TCPServer`, define a subclass which overrides the `handle_stream`
    method.

    `TCPServer` can serve SSL traffic with Python 2.6+ and OpenSSL.
    To make this server serve SSL traffic, send the ssl_options dictionary
    argument with the arguments required for the `ssl.wrap_socket` method,
    including "certfile" and "keyfile"::

       TCPServer(ssl_options={
           "certfile": os.path.join(data_dir, "mydomain.crt"),
           "keyfile": os.path.join(data_dir, "mydomain.key"),
       })

    `TCPServer` initialization follows one of three patterns:

    1. `listen`: simple single-process::

            server = TCPServer()
            server.listen(8888)
            IOLoop.instance().start()

    2. `bind`/`start`: simple multi-process::

            server = TCPServer()
            server.bind(8888)
            server.start(0)  # Forks multiple sub-processes
            IOLoop.instance().start()

       When using this interface, an `IOLoop` must *not* be passed
       to the `TCPServer` constructor.  `start` will always start
       the server on the default singleton `IOLoop`.

    3. `add_sockets`: advanced multi-process::

            sockets = bind_sockets(8888)
            tornado.process.fork_processes(0)
            server = TCPServer()
            server.add_sockets(sockets)
            IOLoop.instance().start()

       The `add_sockets` interface is more complicated, but it can be
       used with `tornado.process.fork_processes` to give you more
       flexibility in when the fork happens.  `add_sockets` can
       also be used in single-process servers if you want to create
       your listening sockets in some way other than
       `bind_sockets`.
