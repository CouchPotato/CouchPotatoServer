        It is an modified version of Jimmy Retzlaff's pyUnRAR - more simple,
        stable and foolproof.
        Notice that it has INCOMPATIBLE interface.
        
        It enables reading and unpacking of archives created with the
        RAR/WinRAR archivers. There is a low-level interface which is very
        similar to the C interface provided by UnRAR. There is also a
        higher level interface which makes some common operations easier.
